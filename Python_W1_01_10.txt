Question: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

Solution:
s1 = 2000
s2 = 3200
s3 = []
while s1 < s2 :
	if (s1%7 == 0) and (s1%5 != 0):
		s3.append(str(s1))
	s1 = s1+1
print(','.join(s3))

Question: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
num = input("Please enter a number to find out its factorial: ")
num = int(num)

num1 = num

if num <0:
	print("Enter a valid number")
elif num<2:
	print(1)
else:
	while num > 1:
		num1 = num1*(num-1)
		num -= 1
	print(num1)

Question: With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. Consider use dict()

Solution:
n = int(input("Write a Integral number: "))

if n < 0:
	print("Enter a positive number")
else:
	print(dict([(i, i*i) for i in range(1,n+1)]))

Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 34,67,55,33,12,98 Then, the output should be: ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98'] ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. tuple() method can convert list to tuple

Solution:
x = input("Enter values : " )
y = x.split(",")
print(y)
print(tuple(y))

Question: Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H] Following are the fixed values of C and H: C is 50. H is 30. D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence. Example Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program: 100,150,180 The output of the program should be: 18,22,24

Hints: If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26) In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
c = 50
h = 30
d = input("comma separated values pls ")
d = d.split(",")
q = [str(round(pow((2*c*int(d)/h),0.5))) for d in d]
print(','.join(q))

Question: Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j. Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1. Example Suppose the following inputs are given to the program: 3,5 Then, the output of the program should be: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

Hints: Note: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input in a comma-separated form.

Solution:
x = int(input("Please enter value for X :"))
y = int(input("Please enter value for Y :"))
print([[(x * y) for y in range(0,y)] for x in range(0,x)])

Question: Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: without,hello,bag,world Then, the output should be: bag,hello,without,world

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
l = input("Please enter comma-separated words :")
l = l.split(",")
print(l)
l.sort()
print(",".join(l))

============================

Question£º Write a program that accepts sequence of lines as input and prints the lines after making all characters in the sentence capitalized. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: Hello world Practice makes perfect Then, the output should be: HELLO WORLD PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
l = input("Enter sequence of lines separated by comma : ")
l = l.split(",")
for i in range(len(l)):
	l[i] = l[i].upper()
	print(l[i])

============================

Question: Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again Then, the output should be: again and hello makes perfect practice world

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input. We use set container to remove duplicated data automatically and then use sorted() to sort the data.

Solution:
x = input("Enter sequence of whitespace separated words : ")
x = x.split(" ")
x = list(set(x))
x.sort()
print(' '.join(x))

============================

Question: Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence. Example: 0100,0011,1010,1001 Then the output should be: 1010 Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
l = []
x = input("Please enter sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers : ")
x = x.split(',')
for i in range(len(x)):
	if int(x[i],2)%5 ==0 :
		l.append(x[i])
print(','.join(l))
